# AoC2022
Advent of Code 2022

To run the code:

```
python aoc2022.py --dir dir --day D --star S
```
with:

- dir is the input data directory name
- D is the day number
- S is the star number (1 or 2)

## My difficulties

### Day 1 - Calorie Counting

As usual, the first exercises aren't really difficult. My main point was that I hadn't prepared my environment yet.
I had to copy/update my 2019 setup (better than my 2020 one) and I really did the exercises so late!

### Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors

I hesitated: should I rename ABC and XYZ to rock-paper-scissor, to really understand what are the fight? 
Should I at least rename XYZ to ABC?
Finally, I decided to create a map saying for each letter which letter it beats, eith ABC and XYZ letters.

### Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization

I didn't really remember how the `re` library worked but after a quick check on Internet, I found this day easy.

### Day 4 - Camp Cleanup

For the partial overlap exercise, I had a moment when I thought: "Should I take into account the case that an intervall
would be described in the descending order?"
I decided not to do it and that was coll. Such easier to code if an overlap only means that the right number of the 
first interval is higher than the left number of the second interval, or the inverse.

### Day 5 - Supply Stacks

OK, serious data parsing starts here. I am not the one who copies her input data and reorders it manually. But I decided
that I could use numpy to transpose my array-like data :laughing:

The rest wasn't a big problem.

### Day 6 - Tuning Trouble

Actually, my answer was so short that I think that this problem wasn't for a Python developer.

### Day 7 - No Space Left On Device

Ouch, it hurted! I decided immediately that I should be clean in my code: creating a Directory and a File class, methods
to navigate, to evaluate the sizes. I started it pretty well but it took so much time that I had to finish during the 
next weekend.

My Directory class had attributes `parentDirectory` and `childrenDirectories` but it wasn't so clear at the begining 
how I could navigate but keeping what I had already stored in my previous directory. 
I finally created a `__copy__` method. I imagine that anyone who has already studied the object programming would have
known it... I have learned all my knowledge about objects simply coding them. 
(_Yes, I should at least read a book about object-oriented programming._)

To be honest, I realized afterward that I was also helped by the fact that a friend from Ladies of Code said that two 
different directories could have the same name. Without this little sentence, I would have tried to define my 
directories by their names. Sorority is great.

### Day 8 - Treetop Tree House

It is not my cleanest piece of code, to be honest. And I know that making it clear wouldn't be so easy. 
Another point is that I was frustrated not to find a nice way to find the first digit in a list that if higher than a 
given input.

Well, I did it and at least it is readable.

### Day 9 - Rope Bridge

The first star was OK. But then... I thoght that extend the rope would be straightforward. Actually, not.

First, I decided to keep my "head" and create a "tail" with more than one node. And then, each node would have to 
follow the previous one. But it was a nightmare to understand what I was writing.
After my saturday shower, I realized that in fact what I could do was:
- first calculate the whole path of the head,
- then calculate the whole path of the first follower,
- and iterate on all the nodes

It was a way easier, even if I needed to refactor my first star code.

Then, the two test cases passed. But my first answer was too low! I couldn't figure the problem. I spent a certain 
amount of time then to print my rope last node path in an understandable way and checked. The problem occured only after
enough steps, with enough nodes in the rope. Sometimes, I jumped a cell! OK, it was because you can meet the case where
the previous node is 2 cells away both in the vertical and in the horizontal direction. It didn't happen with small 
ropes/small amount of steps.

### Day 10 - Cathode-Ray Tube

I am not like everyone. I didn't have hoard moments with the starting cycle at 0, but the starting X value set to 1. 
Even this question of "during the cycle" and "after the cycle" was pretty clear for me.

I had more problems with the second part and the sprite. My brain really wanted that the CRT would follow the 
instructions and the sprite would sweep along the screen. I had alwas to fight against my brain. At the end, I managed 
to obtain the result but:
- first I was not sure. I had to copy my answer, paste it in Excel and add a conditional formatting to read the letters.
- and finally... my first column is still wrong. I know that I have still an error in the code but anyway, haven't I 
proposed the good eight letters?

### Day 11 - Monkey in the Middle

This data was quite simple to parse, actually. 
My first thought was just: "I hope that the test is always about a division!"
What I don't like in my code is that I use an `eval` but that's the hard law of the life.

For the second part, obviously I got into a problem of too large numbers first. Then (after another shower) I realized 
that I could work with the rest of divisions for each item. So, in place of representing 42 by 42, if the monkeys 
divisors are 5 and 7, I represent it by `{5: 2, 7: 0}`. I took a sheet of paper to verify that I could work with a 
square function with this representation 
(My daughters: "What are you doing mum? We don't need any help in maths." Me: "Well, _I_ would need your help if you 
were nice mathematical daughters.")

And the day after, a friend from Ladies of Code told me that we had already run in such a problem in a previous AoC...

### Day 12 - Hill Climbing Algorithm

I was like "well, now Val√©rie you need to write a recursive function." And I was quite proud that I did it quite fast.
It ran well on the test example. But on my input data, it wasn't the same story. So after waiting tooo long, I decided 
to try something else.

Honestly, my husband was a great help. He just told me: "I did it like Liquid War." And anybody who knows the Liquid 
War algorithm(*) knows that there is a simple mapping that works very well here. 
Once you have the mapping, both exercises are easy to do.

(*) Well, that means: him, Thomas Colcombet, and me + the ones who have read this page: 
https://ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5/techinfo/algorithm

### Day 13 - Distress Signal

49 years old and still afraid by recursivity. It took me so many years to understand that you first define the stop
condition! But OK, let's go. At least, the parsing is easy in Python.

Then I had to make some small changes because I compared lists and integers in some cases, even if I really tried to
avoid this.

And last but not least: when I parse the data, I remove the last item by default. **It is not a good idea when the
separator is `\n\n` in place of `\n`.** Each time, I forget. Each time, my test passes and not my puzzle input.
Shame on me.

Finally: my program ran, the test was OK, but I didn't get the good answer. I think that it is because of this, in the
instructions: _If the lists are the same length and no comparison makes a decision about the order, continue checking
the next part of the input._. In my case, if the first list is empty, I say "OK", it is the smallest one. I forgot to
check if the right one is empty too. And it is not so easy: I have to keep the right side of my packets for this...

It took me so much time to deal with the equalities... Recursivity and my brain: not best friends.

For the second part, I simply decided to implement a merge sort algorithm because I discovered it not such long ago and
I liked the idea. It was really easy for me.

### Day 14: Regolith Reservoir

No problem to do the first star. But I decided to define the rocks only but a list of their coordinates. It was OK, but
for the second star it led me to a real performance problem. It wasn't such a deal to define the rocks in a matrix-like
map. But needed to do it again from scratch. Obviously, at a moment I got an error... OK, done. The second star needs
only concentration and precision.

### Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone

#### Not finished

I parsed the easiest way: "OK, there are 8 splits if I split with the good pattern, and the beacon coordinates are the
values 5 and 7 in the list". If you remove one space in a line, nothing works anymore. Not a strong parsing, but it's
OK.

Then I struggled with the intervals : is this value excluded or included? Always the same questions. First star was OK,
then. But my code scans each line to count the intervals covered by the sensors. It ran for the second star but was way
too long on my real input. So I decided to scan all the 4 millions raw map in one step and then use it to detect the
first row with an empty cell. But I had to deal with negative + positive values, limits of the map... Long story short:
I dropped because I spent too much time on this one and my previous (Day 22).

### Day 16: Proboscidea Volcanium

#### Not done at all

We need a graph, my terror. I only started to define the valves and even this, I didn't finish, because fear of not
managing the day anyway. My idea, if I had time: I have 30 minutes and 2 minutes at least by valve. I define all the
combinations for 15 valves with a non-zero flow in the list. Then For each combination: 

- first I calculate the shortest path to go to the first valve. I update the data. 
- If the remaining time is not enough, I remove the last valves.
- maybe for each combination, I calculate the best final flow if all the paths from valve to valve would be 1?
- then I can, each step, check if some combinations of valves need to be removed. I think so, because if I start by the
  more efficient valve as a first valve, I can prune many combinations really fast.

I would use a DFS algorith I think, actually: depth search first: I try the first branch, and it will allow me to prune
some branches during the process.

### Day 17: Pyroclastic Flow

#### Not finished

A Tetris! My main problem in the first star was that I forgot a rock shape in my list of rocks. I had also to define a
specific function to check if a rock wants to go I a place where all of its cells are free. Finally: never forget to
raise an exception if a patter is not recognized: how many times did I use only a if...else but actually, I entered a
third value because my parsing had a problem (like ready the last return character in the input file).

Second star: I thought about it but it's a mess. I need to determine a cycle. But the cycle won't start from the step 0,
as in the beginning, we are on a flat floor, but after 1064 steps (the length of the jets pattern), we don't start again
on a flat floor. I imagine that there would be something at a moment and that if I keep the relative positions of the 5
first drops in a series of jet pattern, it would be enough. But not totally sure. And then, after:

- I have to calculate the height before the cycles
- I have to calculate how many cycles
- I have to calculate the overlap between two consecutive cycles
- I have to calculate the last steps, from the end of a cycle (with its overlap)

### Day 18: Boiling Boulders

#### Not finished

For the first part, I decide to add 6 faces each time I added a cube, and then remove 2 faces for each neighbour it
glued with. It works fine.

For the second part, I wanted first to determine, for each free cell, if there are no occupied cells in one direction
from it, to the border. But it isn't true, you can have a path with is not linear. After thinking about the shape of the
bubbles, my conclusion was that it is better to star from the outside: I build a large cube containing all the occupied
cells and then I remove a cell from neighbour to neighbour if the cell is not occupied by a rock. So I won't remove the
cells inside. It was my idea.

But now I think that I would better add a water ceil for each neighbour if not occupied. And In the end, I calculate the
surface of the water cells, and remove the surface of the outside cube. But maybe it is similar in terms of performance.
I could also check which list of cells is the shortest.

### Day 19: Not Enough Minerals

#### Not done at all

One more graph problem...

First important think: it is always the same idea: the ore and the clay robots are built of ores, the obs robots are
builds of ores + clay, the geode robots are built of ore + obs. It is important to notice: no change in this pattern,
for any blueprint.

My main idea is that what we really want are geode robots. So we would make:

- as many geode robots as we can.
- as many obs or ore robots to complete the left reserve after building the geode robots
- as many obs + ore robots to build complete geode robots
- once done: would I prefer to build more obs robots or more ore robots? Build the ones to complete a entire number of
  obs robots pattern

I am pretty sure that there is something deterministic, maybe with a range of freedom of +/- n in a "previous depth"
robot. But I need to try and adjust. And I also know that all the people I know who managed to run their programs used
heuristics and are not sure to have reached the best value, except the fact that the AoC accepted their answer.

### Day 20: Grove Positioning System

My main problem was that I didn't deal well with the case when a number is higher than the length of the list. I had to
add another test, that I did manually on a sheet of paper. And then: I returned the good list, but the last digit on the
first place. It is totally OK, but as I also checked the complete list in my test, I had to figure out it... And to
change the expected value.

Concerning the second star, as I used congruences from the beginning, I had no difficulty. I only needed to ensure that
I didn't recalculate the position of each number before mixing the list again.

### Day 21: Monkey Math

First star: Always problems with recursivity. This time, I forgot to return something in the case I am not in the stop
condition. Once I did it, it was easy.

Second star: I thought a short time about recursivity. But in the end it was fun to "inverse the monkeys". I took a
facility, nevertheless: I knew that the human, was the left part of an addition. I didn't test to create the
corresponding monkey-human operation.

### Day 22: Monkey Map

#### Not finished

First star: 

First, I wanted to define the position with local coordinates. But actually, at each turn, I could get a mistake, and it
was not easy to debug. So I went back to a global coordinates system. It was almost OK... I spent many hours on it,
finally asked my husband to pass my input and give me the coordinates at each step. I had the same! 1 hour later... I
let a subtraction to go from the global to the local coordinates when providing the result. I removed this subtraction
(that removed 0 in the test sample, reason why I didn't see it) and it works. Holly sh***t.

Second star:

I have to define each "line" of the cube: wich part belongs to which face, in which direction. I think that it is
possible. But I don't have the courage to go into it at the moment. And maybe... I should have kept my local
coordinates...

### Day 23: Unstable Diffusion

Once I decided to describe the problem correctly in two classes, it was pretty straightforward to do the part 1.
Problems:

- the elves depend on the map and the map depends on the elves. Must be cautious on it (when I move an elf, I move its 
  elves map at the same time).
- Also: never forget to add 1 in a range to get the last value.
- to round the orientations, I decided to create a sequence of directions for each first direction. The easiest way.

I had forecasted that the second step was to define the number of round to spread totally the elves. I decided to do it
like a dumb, and it worked: I increased my margins around the map and then ran the moves until the elves don't want to
change their places anymore. It was a little long (some seconds) but OK. I worried that my increased margins weren't
enough. With only 100 extra borders, it was OK! And thanks to my elfes objects that are able to tell me at any moment if
they want to move or not, it was really easy to define the stop condition.

### Day 24: Blizzard Basin

Talking with Christian, I realized that the map was deterministic, so actually, it is just a travel in a 3D map with
some limitations (you can't go to the Z-) So my idea is that I will map the 3D map and count like in day 12 the lengths
of the possible paths. Let's see.

Actually, I was able to do it easily. Only one point: Christian told me that I could have to wait before entering the
blizzards. It helped me to forecast this case from the beginning.

The second star was exactly the same thing, totally no problem with my algorithm.

### Day 25: Full of Hot Air

Decode the snafu was easy for me. Encode it again gave me more trouble. Finally, I decided to encore in base 5 first,
and then read it from right to left, using kind of carried number for the 3, 4, and 5 (due to a previous carried
number).

And then, obviously, the second star is still blocked because I didn't finish the rest.

## Summary

I am a little frustrated to stop. I feel like the 2019 AoC: I had just finished, in time, all the 2020 one, so I decided
to do it after. But I kept blocked on one day and I dropped. Here, same feeling: even if I could finish some other
stars:

- I am pretty sure that some will still resist
- I will spend all my holiday week on it

What went well: 
- my test driven development. Not perfect, I will prepare something better for next year, with less
rigidity. But it was still nice to have it.
- speaking with my husband. We had different ideas. Speaking helped us to write our code with many good tips.
- Ladies of Code leaderboard, with ladies participating. Because we weren't only Paola and me competing like in 2020,
  but also other ladies continue day after day (not enough). It is nice to be together on the same game during a month.

What went wrong:

- I need to have some hand-made functions to deal with 2D maps. Some that I perfectly know and that I can append in 
  case of necessity.
- I need to have some way, already written, to deal with graphs! And maybe this story of Depth Search First.
- my husband doing the AoC with a mechanical keyboard. I was way too stressed because of it. I mustn't be in this kind
  of competition mode! Is it so important to enjoy doing it. (Precision: it is *my* fault, not my husband's. It is OK
  for him to have a mechanical keyboard and to use it.)
- I was too slow to enjoy the reddit feed https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/ because I really prefer to go on it
  when I have finished the exercises of the day.

My idea: do, quietly, the 2021 during the year, to prepare the 2023 with a good tooling.
