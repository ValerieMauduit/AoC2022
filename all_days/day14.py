# Day 14: Regolith Reservoir

# First star: Your scan traces the path of each solid rock structure and reports the x,y coordinates that form the shape
# of the path, where x represents distance to the right and y represents distance down. Each path appears as a single
# line of text in your scan. After the first point of each path, each point indicates the end of a straight horizontal
# or vertical line to be drawn from the previous point.
# The sand is pouring into the cave from point 500,0.
# Sand is produced one unit at a time, and the next unit of sand is not produced until the previous unit of sand comes
# to rest. A unit of sand is large enough to fill one tile of air in your scan. A unit of sand always falls down one
# step if possible. If the tile immediately below is blocked (by rock or sand), the unit of sand attempts to instead
# move diagonally one step down and to the left. If that tile is blocked, the unit of sand attempts to instead move
# diagonally one step down and to the right. Sand keeps moving as long as it is able to do so, at each step trying to
# move down, then down-left, then down-right. If all three possible destinations are blocked, the unit of sand comes to
# rest and no longer moves, at which point the next unit of sand is created back at the source.
# Using your scan, simulate the falling sand. How many units of sand come to rest before sand starts flowing into the
# abyss below?

# Second star: You realize you misread the scan. There isn't an endless void at the bottom of the scan - there's floor,
# and you're standing on it! You don't have time to scan the floor, so assume the floor is an infinite horizontal line
# with a y coordinate equal to two plus the highest y coordinate of any point in your scan. Using your scan, simulate
# the falling sand until the source of the sand becomes blocked. How many units of sand come to rest?
